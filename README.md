Welcome to Local Translator, a Chrome extension that allows you to translate web pages instantly and privately. Below are simple steps to download and install the extension.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

To use Local Translator, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Chrome version:** 138 or higher (desktop only)
- **Experimental Translation API:** Must be enabled in Chrome flags. To enable, type `chrome://flags` in the address bar, search for "Translation," and set it to enabled.

## üíª Download & Install

1. **Visit the Releases Page**: First, navigate to our [Releases page](https://github.com/SolomonBafna/local-translator/releases) to get the latest version of the Local Translator extension.

2. **Download the Extension**: Look for the file with the latest version. Click on it to download the extension file.

3. **Install the Extension**:
   - After the download is complete, open Chrome.
   - Go to `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
   - Enable "Developer mode" located in the upper right corner.
   - Drag and drop the downloaded file into the extensions page.
   - Confirm any prompts to install the extension.

4. **Activate the Extension**: Once installed, you'll see the Local Translator icon in your Chrome toolbar. Click it to activate the extension.

## üìë How It Works

Local Translator translates web pages without sending your data to external servers. It uses Chrome's built-in Translator API on your device. Here‚Äôs how to use it:

- **Translate Entire Pages**: Click the Local Translator icon to translate the whole page instantly.
- **Translate Selective Text**: If you want to translate only a part of the text, hold the Alt (or Option on Mac) key and click on the text. It will show the translation right away.

## üé® Customization Options

Local Translator offers various options to customize how translations appear on your screen:

- **Overlay Mode**: This shows the translation directly below the original text, allowing you to see both at the same time.
- **Replace Mode**: This replaces the original text with the translation, offering a cleaner look if you want to focus solely on the translated content.

## üíæ Persistent Settings

Your preferences are saved automatically. The next time you use the extension, it will remember your chosen translation modes and display options.

## ‚ö° Auto-Enable Feature

Local Translator automatically activates based on your saved preferences. You don't have to remember to enable it each time you visit a new page. This makes web browsing faster and easier.

## üéØ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the Local Translator, consider the following:

1. **Check Chrome Version**: Make sure you have the correct version.
2. **API Settings**: Verify that the Experimental Translation API is enabled.
3. **Extension Issues**: Disable and re-enable the extension on the extensions page if it doesn't work as expected.
